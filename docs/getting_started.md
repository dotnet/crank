## Description

This tutorial shows how to benchmark a simple .NET web application using the __bombardier__ load generation tool.

## Installing crank

1. Install [.NET Core](<http://dot.net>).
2. Install Crank via the following command:

    ```text
    dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Crank.Controller --version "0.2.0-*" 
    ```

    ```text
    dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Crank.Agent --version "0.2.0-*" 
    ```

3. Verify the installation was complete by running:

    ```
    crank
    ```

Note: The agent is not required locally to execute a benchmark if it's already installed on a remote
server. These steps only assume that you are getting started with __crank__ and that the agent
isn't available anywhere else yet.

## Define the scenario

The following content is available at https://github.com/dotnet/crank/blob/main/samples/hello/hello.benchmarks.yml

It contains the scenario definitions, describing which applications need to be deployed to run a benchmark.

```yml
imports:
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/crank/main/src/Microsoft.Crank.Jobs.Bombardier/bombardier.yml

jobs:
  server:
    source:
      repository: https://github.com/dotnet/crank
      branchOrCommit: main
      project: samples/hello/hello.csproj

scenarios:
  hello:
    application:
      job: server
    load:
      job: bombardier
      variables:
        serverPort: 5000
        path: /

profiles:
  local:
    variables:
      serverAddress: localhost
    jobs: 
      application:
        endpoints: 
          - http://localhost:5010
      load:
        endpoints: 
          - http://localhost:5010
```

## Start the agent

To run the benchmark at least one agent instance needs to be running. It will run the service named  __application__ that will host the web application to benchmark, and the service name __load__ that will host the bombardier load generation.

Ideally, services are deployed on separate machines but for the sake of this tutorial as single agent is used, and both the application and load generation will run locally.

Open a shell and execute these command lines:

```
> crank-agent
...
Now listening on: http://[::]:5010
...
Agent ready, waiting for jobs...
```

At that point the agent is ready to accept jobs locally on the port `5010`.

## Run a scenario using the controller

The scenario definitions file is already created and available.

```
> crank --config /crank/samples/hello/hello.benchmarks.yml --scenario hello --profile local

Each service deployed (application and load) have reported their metrics, including the Requests Per Second.

Note: The agent and controller can also be executed [directly from source](development.md) if dotnet tools can't be installed.

## Windows Defender notifications

On Windows you'll get a popup alert every time an app is started. To discard these follow these steps:

- Open the __Windows Security__ application from the __Start__ menu
- Click on __Settings__ at the bottom left
- Turn the firewall notifications off
