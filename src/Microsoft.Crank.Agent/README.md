## Running Crank.Agent as a service

At the moment, only Windows service is supported.

Deploy the agent as a dotnet tool (or published), and register the windows service with

```
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Crank.Agent --version "0.2.0-*" 
sc.exe create "CrankAgentService" binpath= "%USERPROFILE%\crank-agent.exe --url http://*:5001 --service"
```

You also should add the `--dotnethome` and `--build-path` parameters, in order to reuse sdk, and have a dedicated workspace for building and compiling.

The windows service must run with an account having rights on all the folders.
You may also need to allow the exposed port on your Windows firewall.

## Removing the service

To delete the service, use these commands:

```
sc.exe stop "CrankAgentService"
sc.exe delete "CrankAgentService"
```
