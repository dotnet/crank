# Microsoft.Crank

[![Build Status](https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/public/_apis/build/status/dotnet/crank/dotnet-crank-ci-public?branchName=main)](https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/public/_build/latest?definitionId=848&branchName=main)

Crank is the benchmarking infrastructure used by the .NET team to run benchmarks including (but not limited to) scenarios from the [TechEmpower Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/).

One of the goals of this system is to give developers a tool that lets them work on performance and measure potential improvements very easily. Some of the capabilities are:

- Deploy and benchmark multi-tiered applications based on .NET or Docker containers
- Store results in JSON or in SQL Server for charting
- Customize the applications or their environment to test different settings 
- Collect traces

## Components

The benchmarking infrastructure is made of these components:
- [crank-agent](src/Microsoft.Crank.Agent) - A service that executes jobs that run as part of a benchmark
- [crank](src/Microsoft.Crank.Controller) - A command line utility that can enqueue jobs and record results

There are also some built in jobs:
- [wrk](src/Microsoft.Crank.Jobs.Wrk) - An http client benchmarking tool. This tool is used when benchmarking TechEmpower https://github.com/wg/wrk (Linux only).
- [wrk2](src/Microsoft.Crank.Jobs.Wrk2) - An http client benchmarking tool optimized for latency testing https://github.com/giltene/wrk2 (Linux only).
- [bombardier](src/Microsoft.Crank.Jobs.Bombardier) - A go based http client benchmarking tool https://github.com/codesenberg/bombardier (cross-platform).

## Get Started

- Read the [documentation](docs)
- Install the crank controller dotnet tool: `dotnet tool update Microsoft.Crank.Controller --version "0.2.0-*" --global`
- Use some [predefined scenarios](https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/tree/master/scenarios)
