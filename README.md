# Microsoft.Benchmarks

This is the benchmarking infrastructure used by the .NET team using run including (but not limited to) scenarios from the [TechEmpower Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/).

## Components

The benchmarking infrastructure is made of these components:
- [benchmarks-agent](src/Microsoft.Benchmarks.Agent) - A web application that contains different scenarios to benchmark.
- [benchmarks](src/Microsoft.Benchmarks.Controller) - A command-line application that can enqueue jobs and display the results locally (or store them in a database).
